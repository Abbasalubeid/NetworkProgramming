Reimplemented [TomcatQuizGame](https://github.com/Abbasalubeid/NetworkProgramming/tree/main/TomcatQuizGame) using Spring Boot and Spring MVC to explore a Spring-centric architecture. The application retains most of the original functionality with the addition of an email feature that uses JavaMail to send quiz results to users.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Manage HTTP requests with Spring MVC.
- **Repositories**: Interface with the database using Spring Data JPA.
- **Services**: Business logic and interactions with repositories.
- **Models**: Entity classes representing database tables.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for efficient data handling.
- **Views**: JSP files for the user interface.


## Studied Concepts

- **Dependency Injection**
- **Spring Data Repositories**
- **Spring MVC vs. Java EE Servlets**
- **Email Service Integration**
