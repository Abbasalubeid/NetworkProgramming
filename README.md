This repository contains practical labs and tasks completed during a course in network programming. This course is a practical version of the theoretical concepts studied in the [Networks and Communication course](https://github.com/Abbasalubeid/NetworksAndCommunication).

## Course contents

- Programs that communicate over sockets with TCP and UDP
- Enciphered sockets with SMTP/IMAP/HTTPS.
- Introduction to application servers (Tomcat) and frameworks (Run).
- Thread handling for the above.
- HTTP/2 and websockets.

## Intended learning outcomes

After a pass mark on course, the student should be able to develop distributed applications that communicate using different communication paradigms and then use appropriate design and architecture.
